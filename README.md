# Mnemonic Memory - Angular - Clarity
This project is a web app that uses the [mnemonic major system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system)
to help you memorize numbers.

The mnemonic major system is a mnemonic technique used to aid in memorizing numbers. The system works by converting
numbers into consonants, then into words by adding vowels. The system works on the principle that images can be
remembered more easily than numbers.

## Live Demo
